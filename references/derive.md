## What Are Derived Runs?

A **derived run** is a new optimization run whose baseline code comes from the best solution in the current lineage. All runs in a derivation chain share a **lineage** — a persistent record that tracks ancestry and the global best solution across every run.

Derive is the **primary steering mechanism** for Weco optimization — and the preferred way to redirect a run, **whether it has completed or is still running**. Don't wait for a running run to finish before steering it, and don't restart from scratch: derive immediately. It inherits the best known solution as a clean baseline, gives the optimizer fresh context for the new direction, and tracks full lineage.

Prefer derive over `weco run instruct` (which edits instructions on a live run without resetting context). Reach for `instruct` only for a minor nudge that doesn't warrant a new direction; for any real change of approach or constraint, derive.

## When to Derive

- User says "try a different approach", "focus on X", "keep going"
- User adds constraints: "don't use Y", "only use Z"
- User wants to redirect a run **that is currently mid-optimization** — derive now, no need to wait for it to finish or to stop it first (derive stops it for you)
- User wants to continue after a run completes: "try more steps", "explore further"
- User wants to branch: "try both approaches"

## How to Derive

Steering is passed via `-i / --additional-instructions` (inline text or path to a file). If omitted, the parent run's instructions are inherited unchanged.

```bash
# From the lineage-best step (global best across ALL runs in the lineage — default)
weco run derive <run-id> \
    --from-step best \
    -i "Focus on memory-efficient data structures" \
    --output plain

# From the best step in just the specified run
weco run derive <run-id> \
    --from-step run-best \
    -i "Try a completely different algorithm" \
    --output plain

# From a specific step number
weco run derive <run-id> \
    --from-step 7 \
    -i "Explore vectorization approaches" \
    --output plain

# With custom step count
weco run derive <run-id> \
    --from-step best \
    -i "Explore vectorization approaches" \
    --steps 50 \
    --output plain

# Inherit the parent's instructions unchanged (no -i)
weco run derive <run-id> --from-step best --output plain
```

### What Happens

1. **The parent run is stopped automatically** — if it is still running, deriving cancels its in-flight evaluation, interrupts any active candidates, and sets it to `stopping`. You do **not** need to call `weco run stop` first; derive handles it. (This is the default behaviour and is not configurable from the CLI.)
2. A new run is created with the selected step's code as its **inherited baseline** (step 0)
3. Step 0 is inherited — no re-evaluation is performed, so no compute is wasted re-measuring a known-good solution
4. The first real candidate in the new run is step 1
5. The new run gets fresh LLM context (no accumulated history)
6. The optimization loop starts immediately
7. Both runs share the same objective (metric, goal, eval command) and the same lineage

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `run_id` | Parent run UUID (required, positional) |
| `--from-step` | `best` (default: lineage-best = global best across ALL runs), `run-best` (best in the specified run only), or a step number |
| `-i, --additional-instructions` | Steering instructions for the new run (inline text or path to a file). If omitted, the parent run's instructions are inherited. |
| `-n, --steps` | Override step count (inherits from parent if omitted) |
| `--api-key` | API keys in `provider=key` format |
| `--output` | `rich` (interactive) or `plain` (machine-readable, use for automation) |

### Lineage Tracking

All derived runs share a **lineage**. Use `weco run status` to see lineage info:

```bash
weco run status <derived-run-id>
```

The response includes `lineage_id` and `derived_from` (the run, step, and node the new run was derived from).

To retrieve the full lineage (all runs, global best, ancestry):

```
GET /v1/lineages/{lineage_id}
```

## Agent Workflow

Derive whenever the user gives a new direction — you don't need to wait for the run to finish first.

- **Run is still running** and the user wants to change direction or add a constraint → derive immediately. Derive stops the running search for you (cancels the in-flight step, sets the parent to `stopping`), so there's no separate stop step.
- **Run has completed** → present results, ask if they'd like to explore further; when they give a direction, derive.

In both cases:

1. **User gives a direction** → `weco run derive <run-id> --from-step best -i "..." --output plain`, launched as a background task
2. **Monitor** → same monitoring loop as any other run

The user doesn't need to know about run IDs, the parent being stopped, or lineage mechanics. From their perspective, you're just "trying a different approach." The run boundaries are an implementation detail.

### Example Conversations

**User asks to pivot:**
```
User: The speed gains are good but I care more about memory now.

Agent: [runs: weco run derive <id> --from-step best -i "Focus
       exclusively on reducing peak memory usage, even at the cost of
       some speed regression" --output plain]
```

**User adds constraints:**
```
User: Don't use PyTorch, only sklearn.

Agent: [runs: weco run derive <id> --from-step best -i "Do NOT
       use torch or transformers. Use sklearn only." --output plain]
```

**User wants to continue after completion:**
```
User: Try architectural changes instead of hyperparameter tuning.

Agent: [runs: weco run derive <id> --from-step best -i "Explore
       different model architectures — try attention mechanisms or
       residual connections" --output plain]
```
